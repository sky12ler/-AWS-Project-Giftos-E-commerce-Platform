Cloud Computing/DevOps Project: AWS Project: Giftos E-commerce Platform

Project Overview: Scalable & Cost-Optimized Website Hosting on AWS
This project focused on deploying a dynamic website on AWS using EC2, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and other services to enhance performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. The system leverages serverless architecture, auto-scaling, and content offloading strategies for global optimization.

Key Features
EC2 Hosting with Auto Scaling & ALB
Deployed the website on EC2 with Auto Scaling for capacity adjustments and Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic.

S3 Integration
Offloaded static content to S3 for better performance and maintenance. Implemented S3 Lifecycle Rules to transition less accessed data to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and Glacier for cost savings.

CloudFront CDN
Integrated CloudFront to cache and serve content globally, reducing latency and improving load times by up to 60%.

Serverless Backend with Lambda & API Gateway
Built a serverless architecture using Lambda and API Gateway to serve dynamic content directly from S3, reducing reliance on EC2 and lowering costs.

Offloading Dynamic Content
Offloaded less important dynamic content to CloudFront, Lambda, and API Gateway, optimizing resources and reducing EC2 load.

Impact
Improved Performance
Reduced global load times by 60% with CloudFront, ensuring faster content delivery worldwide.

Cost Optimization
Reduced EC2 costs by 40% through Lambda + API Gateway and optimized storage expenses by 70% using S3 Intelligent-Tiering and Glacier.

Scalability & Reliability
Achieved seamless scaling and reliable traffic handling with Auto Scaling and ALB, ensuring high availability during traffic spikes.

Enhanced Security
Strengthened security with AWS WAF and Shield, successfully blocking over 100 bot attacks daily.
