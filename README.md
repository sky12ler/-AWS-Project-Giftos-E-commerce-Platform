🌐 Project Overview: Scalable & Cost-Optimized Website Hosting on AWS
This project focused on deploying a dynamic website on AWS using EC2, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and other services to enhance performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. The system leverages serverless architecture, auto-scaling, and content offloading strategies for global optimization.

🚀 Key Features
🖥️ EC2 Hosting with Auto Scaling & ALB
Deployed the website on EC2 with Auto Scaling for capacity adjustments and Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic.

🗂️ S3 Integration
Offloaded static content to S3 for better performance and maintenance. Implemented S3 Lifecycle Rules to transition less accessed data to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and Glacier for cost savings.

🌍 CloudFront CDN
Integrated CloudFront to cache and serve content globally, reducing latency and improving load times by up to 60%.

🧬 Serverless Backend with Lambda & API Gateway
Built a serverless architecture using Lambda and API Gateway to serve dynamic content directly from S3, reducing reliance on EC2 and lowering costs.

📦 Offloading Dynamic Content
Offloaded less important dynamic content to CloudFront, Lambda, and API Gateway, optimizing resources and reducing EC2 load.

🎯 Impact
⚡ Improved Performance
Reduced global load times by 60% with CloudFront, ensuring faster content delivery worldwide.

💰 Cost Optimization
Reduced EC2 costs by 40% through Lambda + API Gateway and optimized storage expenses by 70% using S3 Intelligent-Tiering and Glacier.

📈 Scalability & Reliability
Achieved seamless scaling and reliable traffic handling with Auto Scaling and ALB, ensuring high availability during traffic spikes.

🛡️ Enhanced Security
Strengthened security with AWS WAF and Shield, successfully blocking over 100 bot attacks daily.
